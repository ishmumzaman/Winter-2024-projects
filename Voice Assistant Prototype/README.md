# Voice Assistant Project

## Overview
This Python voice assistant script allows you to automate basic day to day tasks by using voice commands. It can open websites, perform internet searches, fetch stock prices, tell jokes, and many other things. Its design focuses on simplicity and versatility, making it easy to add or remove tasks according to your preferences. The primary motivation behind creating this assistant was to learn libraries such as pyttsx3, speech_recognition, and pywhatkit. It has evolved into a convenient tool to save time on everyday tasks like playing songs or opening emails.

## Key Features
The core functionality revolves around listening to voice commands, interpreting them through speech recognition, and responding with a synthesized voice. It can provide the current day of the week and the time. It can open well known websites like YouTube or general search engines. It can also conduct Wikipedia searches for quick knowledge retrieval. If you say something like “play” plus a keyword, the assistant uses pywhatkit to play music or videos on YouTube. For those who enjoy a bit of humor, it can tell jokes using the pyjokes library. It can even retrieve and announce stock prices for popular companies. When you want to stop using the assistant, you can simply say “goodbye” to end the session.

## Workflow and Logic
The script begins by greeting the user in a friendly manner. It then continuously listens for commands, transforming spoken words into text through the speech_recognition library. Once it interprets the command, the assistant uses a variety of libraries to respond. If the command includes opening YouTube, the webbrowser module is used to launch it in your default browser. If the user mentions an internet search, pywhatkit handles the request and displays search results. If the user wants a Wikipedia summary, the assistant uses the wikipedia library to gather a concise piece of information. Jokes are fetched through pyjokes, and stock information is obtained through the yfinance library. Finally, if the user decides to exit, the loop ends and the assistant says a short goodbye message.

## Libraries in Use
The script relies on multiple libraries to achieve its full potential. It uses pyttsx3 to produce voice output, allowing you to change the voice to different presets if desired. It uses speech_recognition to interpret audio input from your microphone and convert it into text. The pywhatkit library facilitates playing music and performing searches. The yfinance library assists with retrieving stock market data, while pyjokes delivers a variety of jokes. The webbrowser library provides a direct way to open URLs. Python’s built in datetime module is used for retrieving and reading out the current day and time. Wikipedia searches are made possible by the wikipedia library, and you can customize the number of sentences you want in the summary.

## Ease of Customization
One of the main strengths of this script is how straightforward it is to expand or simplify. You can add a new elif block for a fresh command or remove an existing one if it is not needed anymore. You can also replace or modify the stock library, jokes library, or other modules without altering the overall structure. By changing the voice properties in pyttsx3 or pointing to another voice token, you can alter the personality of your assistant to suit your preferences.

## Potential Enhancements
You may incorporate additional modules to extend functionality. For instance, you can connect to a to do application for quick reminders. You can add more commands to interact with emails or calendar events. You can also create a user interface that shows a history of commands and responses. These are just a few ideas to demonstrate how this assistant can grow into a broader productivity tool with minimal effort.

## Conclusion
This voice assistant showcases the power of combining speech recognition, text to speech, and other Python libraries into a single cohesive project. It offers a convenient way to carry out tasks hands free, which can be especially valuable when you need quick responses without manually navigating websites or applications. The modular structure allows you to tailor its functionality to your daily routines and keep expanding it over time. By learning libraries like pyttsx3, speech_recognition, and pywhatkit, you gain familiarity with the fundamental building blocks that power voice assisted applications in Python.
