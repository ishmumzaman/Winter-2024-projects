## Description

This Python voice assistant is designed to automate day to day tasks by listening to spoken commands and executing the appropriate actions. It uses multiple libraries, including pyttsx3 for text to speech, speech_recognition for converting speech into text, and pywhatkit for searching and playing content on YouTube. The main goal was to learn how these libraries work in harmony while also creating a convenient tool for daily use.

The assistant begins by greeting the user and then waits for voice commands. It can recognize various instructions such as opening websites, performing Wikipedia searches, fetching stock prices from yfinance, telling jokes from pyjokes, playing songs on YouTube through pywhatkit, and more. Since these commands are interpreted by comparing the recognized text to predefined keywords, it is simple to add new commands or remove existing ones. This modular approach makes the project easy to expand according to future needs.

In addition to performing simple tasks like telling the time and day, the assistant can be configured to open specific websites like YouTube, Google, or any other platform. It can also handle stock price queries by connecting with yfinance. If the assistant cannot understand a particular command, it provides a message indicating that it did not catch the request, thereby informing the user to repeat or rephrase.

By working with libraries such as pyttsx3 and speech_recognition, this project showcases how to give Python applications the ability to speak and listen effectively. The pywhatkit library offers simple functions for searching the internet and playing videos on YouTube. This combination of libraries yields a practical voice assistant that can be effortlessly extended to support new functionalities. Whether you want to learn about speech to text and text to speech technologies, or you just need a personal helper to play music or tell jokes, this project provides a clear pathway to understand and implement such features in Python.
